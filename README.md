# WumpusWorld
An assignment where me and my teammate create an agent who is supposed to be able to play the game WumpusWorld.

This project is being developed in Java. To build the application use apache ant. To then run the program, run the command "java -jar dist\wumpusworld.jar" from the project directory (WumpusWorld)

The project has an added JSON task in the folder .vscode. This makes it easier for us to test the project while coding in vscode as we can build and run the program from the IDEs own console.
